Running jenkins standalone(jetty or winstone) vs Running Jenkins on Tomcat

You can start all your application on a single server on tomcat, we have mostly application using tomcat server. other reason is tomcat is popular servlet container

------->  (demo-1)  freestyle project -> build steps -> execute shell(we will not use this, this is for unix/linux based environment,It allows you to run commands using a Unix shell, such as Bash.),  
We will use Execute windows batch command(It allows you to run commands using the Windows Command Prompt)

echo "Hello world"
whoami -> will show user
dir -> will show directory
echo. > sample.txt -> to create empty text file

change theme-> goto plugins, get plugin for a theme and in system configurations goto appearance

Role-based-authorization ->> security -> authorization -> role-based strategy. It will create manage and assign roles
In manage and assign roles we can give access to our Users

-> type text.txt  to open a text file

dummy user -> username -> krish password -> krish email -> krish1@gmail.com
