jenkins is a java application so it is pla,tform independent.Used for continuous integration and continuous delivery

to run jenkins go to folder of jenkins and open command prompt 
-> java -jar jenkins.war

username - mohitjhankal
password TWpoYW5rYWwwMUA=

for first time it will ask for password 
-> goto browser http://localhost:8080

Running jenkins standalone(jetty or winstone) vs Running Jenkins on Tomcat

You can start all your application on a single server on tomcat, we have mostly application using tomcat server. other reason is tomcat is popular servlet container

------->  (demo-1)  freestyle project -> build steps -> execute shell(we will not use this, this is for unix/linux based environment,It allows you to run commands using a Unix shell, such as Bash.),  
We will use Execute windows batch command(It allows you to run commands using the Windows Command Prompt)

echo "Hello world"
whoami -> will show user
dir -> will show directory
echo. > sample.txt -> to create empty text file

change theme-> goto plugins, get plugin for a theme and in system configurations goto appearance

Role-based-authorization ->> security -> authorization -> role-based strategy. It will create manage and assign roles
In manage and assign roles we can give access to our Users

/// -----> (demo-2) freesytle project
-> type text.txt  to open a text file
// In execute windows batch command 
echo "Hello world"
cd C:\Users\mohit.jhankal\Desktop\github
git clone https://github.com/mohitjhankal/text_jenkins.git

this will give error if we build again because text_jenkins will already be there! 

->Build Environment
-->Delete workspace before build starts
this will not solve above problem because it will wipeout data from home directory which is C:\Users\mohit.jhankal\.jenkins\workspace\demo-2, and we want to wipe data from C:\Users\mohit.jhankal\Desktop\github. So to solve this problem we going to use 

echo "Hello world"
cd C:\Users\mohit.jhankal\Desktop\github

# Delete the existing text_jenkins directory if it exists
if exist text_jenkins (
    rmdir /s /q text_jenkins
)

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mohitjhankal/text_jenkins.git

Note : cloning from git can be automatically done with plugin
Source Code Management -> Git, put url here https://github.com/mohitjhankal/text_jenkins, and that's it
